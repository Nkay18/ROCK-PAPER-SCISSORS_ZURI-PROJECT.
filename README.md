This is a simple game usually involving two individuals. In this case, the user and the computer. the user is prompted to pick from the choices which include a rock, paper or scissors. The computer is programmed to make a random choice similar to the available choice of the user as there are only three options to chose from. the program also analyses the choices from the computer and user and announces a winner. the overall scope is paper is stronger than rock while rock is stronger than scissors but scissor scuts paper. funny huh?
